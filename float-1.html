    <p>
        I am in the Great Sahara Desert for the third sundown in a row. Fouad and I
        pass back and forth a sun-bleached map of the stars. Itâ€™s more of a tug-of-war
        to be honest. With what remains of the daylight, we commit to memory the
        positions of spots on the page. We hope to find some correlation in its
        negative, which slides overhead as the sun rapidly dies.
